Learning AI AWS services

### 

How does AI work:

- Collect Dataser (eg: images of different fruits - bananas, peaches, apples etc)
- Train model to create a AI model (AI model is a smart comupter code)
- Run a algorithm (eg : Classification Algorithm ) - it groups the images of all the fruits - apples together,  bananas togethe etcr)
- User provides a new image of apple to the model - since model is trained with so many images og apple that it identifies it as an apple
