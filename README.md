Learning AI AWS services

### 

How does AI work:

- Collect Dataser (eg: images of different fruits - bananas, peaches, apples etc)
- Train model to create a AI model (AI model is a smart comupter code)
- Run a algorithm (eg : Classification Algorithm ) - it groups the images of all the fruits - apples together,  bananas togethe etcr)
- User provides a new image of apple to the model - since model is trained with so many images og apple that it identifies it as an apple

### AI Components

- Data Layer
  
  Collect vast amount fa data
  
- ML Framework and Algorithm Layer

  Defina a ML framework to solve a problem

- Model Layer
  
  We set parameter, function, optimizer function to create a actual model and train it

- Application Layer
  
  Expose the model to users

### Machone Laerning

  ML is a type of AI to build methods that allow machines to learn from data. We can make prediction based on data used to train the models.

**Regression**

Regression is a machine learning technique used to predict numerical values based on past data.
Example: Predicting house prices based on size, location, and amenities.

**Classification**

Classification is used when we need to categorize data into groups.
Example: Classifying emails as spam or not spam, or recognizing if an image contains a dog or a cat.

**Deep Learning**

Deep learning is an advanced type of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to process data and learn patterns.
Example: Deep learning powers speech recognition, self-driving cars, and AI-generated images.
