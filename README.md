# AWS AI
Learning AI AWS services

### 

How does AI work:

- Collect Dataser (eg: images of different fruits - bananas, peaches, apples etc)
- Train model to create a AI model (AI model is a smart comupter code)
- Run a algorithm (eg : Classification Algorithm ) - it groups the images of all the fruits - apples together,  bananas togethe etcr)
- User provides a new image of apple to the model - since model is trained with so many images og apple that it identifies it as an apple

### AI Components

- Data Layer
  
  Collect vast amount fa data
  
- ML Framework and Algorithm Layer

  Defina a ML framework to solve a problem

- Model Layer
  
  We set parameter, function, optimizer function to create a actual model and train it

- Application Layer
  
  Expose the model to users

  ### Machone Laerning

  ML is a type of AI to build methods that allow machines to learn from data. We can make prediction based on data used to train the models.
