Learning AI AWS services

### 

How does AI work:

- Collect Dataser (eg: images of different fruits - bananas, peaches, apples etc)
- Train model to create a AI model (AI model is a smart comupter code)
- Run a algorithm (eg : Classification Algorithm ) - it groups the images of all the fruits - apples together,  bananas togethe etcr)
- User provides a new image of apple to the model - since model is trained with so many images og apple that it identifies it as an apple

### AI Components

- Data Layer
  
  Collect vast amount fa data
  
- ML Framework and Algorithm Layer

  Defina a ML framework to solve a problem

- Model Layer
  
  We set parameter, function, optimizer function to create a actual model and train it

- Application Layer
  
  Expose the model to users

### Machone Laerning

  ML is a type of AI to build methods that allow machines to learn from data. We can make prediction based on data used to train the models.

**Regression**

Regression is a machine learning technique used to predict numerical values based on past data.
Example: Predicting house prices based on size, location, and amenities.

**Classification**

Classification is used when we need to categorize data into groups.
Example: Classifying emails as spam or not spam, or recognizing if an image contains a dog or a cat.

**Deep Learning**

Deep learning is an advanced type of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to process data and learn patterns.
Example: Deep learning powers speech recognition, self-driving cars, and AI-generated images.

Neural Networks
Neural networks are inspired by how the human brain works. They consist of layers of nodes (neurons) that process data in a structured way.
Example: Facial recognition on smartphones uses neural networks to detect faces.

Newral network example:

A neural network is trained to recognize handwritten numberts.
Tge input layer process pixel data while the hiddenlayers identify features like lines and curves. For instance, vertical lines are present in numbers 1, 4 and 7 so a layer might detect such lines. Similarly, the numbers 6, 8 and 0 have curved buttoms which another layer may recognize. By combining these learned features, the network can accurately identify numbers

Generative AI (Gen-AI) 

It refers to artificial intelligence that uses foundation models trained on vast amounts of unlabeled data to generate new contentâ€”such as text, images, music, and code. These models learn underlying patterns and relationships, allowing them to adapt to different generation tasks without needing specific training for each scenario. This adaptability makes Gen-AI powerful for tasks like content creation, automated design, and AI-assisted problem-solving.
